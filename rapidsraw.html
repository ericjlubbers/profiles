<p><i>In soccer, as in most sports, a team's spine is crucial. Strength down the middle of the field is a core building block. This offseason, the Colorado Rapids aimed to bring in players with some edge to anchor the defensive part of the club's spine. Here's the spine of the 2015 Rapids.</i></p>

<center><h3>Clint Irwin</h3></center>

<p></p>
<p>Colorado enters 2015 with two quality, MLS-experienced goalkeepers available to patrol the penalty area behind its defense. And despite coach Pablo Mastroeni's glib remarks last season that his club would petition to use two keepers at once, it will have to settle for one at a time.</p>
<p>The hot hand is Irwin, who turns 26 in April. He shut out the Philadelphia Union in the season opener. His challenger, 23-year-old Zac MacMath, was ineligible to play because he's on loan from Philly and can't play against his parent club. </p>
<p>"Those two are going to push each other really hard," goalkeepers coach Chris Sharpe said earlier this month.</p>
<p>The two are physically similar; at 6-foot-3, 195 pounds, Irwin has an inch and a pound on MacMath. But MacMath has 102 MLS starts and 28 shutouts, while Irwin has 57 starts and 18 shutouts. The competition between them has been "phenomenal," Sharpe said earlier this month. "I've been here for eight years, it's probably the best it's been since I've been here." </p>
<p>Sharpe said that the two were "neck-and-neck" during the preseason, and that he's sure MacMath will be ready if called upon.</p>
<p>Irwin, meanwhile, will try to return to his 2013 form, which had him in the U.S. National Team conversation.</p>
<p>"They're both young, they're both hungry, they both have short and long term goals, they both have ambitions of being the best," Sharpe said.</p>

<center><h3>Shane O'Neill</h3></center>

<p></p>
<p>It's hard to get around these numbers: Since the start of 2013, Colorado is 4-18-2 when O'Neill is not in the starting 11. The Rapids' home-grown center back uses every ounce of his 6-foot-2, 190-pound frame to frustrate opposing attackers, and he picked up a half-dozen yellow cards in 21 matches last season.</p>
<p>Fresh off his second consecutive U.S. National Team camp in January, the Fairview High School grad is firmly in the picture for the 2016 U.S. Olympic team, which means he will likely miss time this season if called up for Olympic qualifying matches.</p>
<p>When asked this week about his goals this season, the former Colorado High School Player of the Year said, "I want to help the team any way I can, but I'd be lying to you if I told you I don't want to score a couple of goals this year." </p>
<p>O'Neill, a center forward in high school, scored his first MLS goal last season vs. Montreal.</p> 
<p>"I also want to help the team get some clean sheets," he said. "I remember a few seasons ago, we were one of the top defenses in the league and we want to get back there and make a name for ourselves again."</p>

<center><h3>Axel Sjoberg</h3></center>

<p></p>
<p>The last few months have been a wild ride for the rookie center back. He left his native Sweden at the beginning of January, went straight to the MLS combine, and then to the SuperDraft, where he was taken No. 14 overall by Colorado. The Rapids traded up to grab their man. Then it was off to Colorado and preseason trips to San Diego, Las Vegas and Tucson, where Sjoberg scored his first goal in Rapids burgundy &mdash; a header and a game-winner against FC Tucson to send Colorado to the final of the Desert Diamond Cup. </p>
<p>The next thing he knew, Sjoberg was the Rapids' starting center back in their season opener in Philadelphia. "It's been a roller coaster and the best rollercoaster there is," Sjoberg said last week. </p>
<p>In his MLS debut, the 6-foot-7 defender became the tallest player in league history.</p>
<p>Rapids sporting director Padraig Smith was pleased with Sjoberg's performance, as he helped the Rapids earn the clean sheet. "You see someone like Axel come in and have the game that he did &mdash; he had 22 clearances and 26 CBI (clearances, blocks, and interceptions), which is a huge number," Smith said.</p>

<center><h3>Sam Cronin</h3></center>

<p></p>
<p>The central defensive midfielder was high on Colorado's wish list this offseason, and it's easy to see why. Cronin has received praise for his grind-it-out style. </p>
<p>"I'll always be a competitive player for the team, always give my best for the team," Cronin said in January. "I'm a selfless player who will put in a lot of unseen work to help the team tick." </p>
<p>The 28-year-old has also proved to be a leader early in his Colorado tenure &mdash; on the field and off. Cronin helped represent the Rapids' players in collective bargaining negotiations and has filled in as captain, along with Marcelo Sarvas. Smith said in February the Rapids landed an intelligent, hard-working player who "knows how to snuff out danger."</p>

<center><h3>Marcelo Sarvas</h3></center>

<p></p>
<p>One of the most important offseason acquisitions for the Rapids, the 33-year-old Brazilian arrived in Colorado via a SuperDraft-day deal with the Los Angeles Galaxy in January. Sarvas, a teammate of Mastroeni's in 2013, was a key cog in L.A.'s last two MLS Cup titles, having paired with Juninho in central midfield. </p>
<p>"Marcelo, for me, was one of the best midfielders in the league last year," Mastroeni said in January. "And I got to spend six months playing with him, so you get to really find out the kind of personalities they are. I've been around a long time, and this guy's a winner." </p>
<p>Beyond his defensive strengths, Sarvas is also very good at pulling the strings in the attack; he has nine goals and 19 assists in 88 league games. </p>
<p>"He's a leader, he's a winner," Smith said in February. "He's somebody who will bring a huge amount of experience and football know-how to what is a young but incredibly talented corps."</p>
<p>Sarvas wore the captain's armband in the Rapids' season opener and is expected to be the first-choice captain until Drew Moor returns from injury.</p>

<center><h3>Gabriel Torres</h3></center>
<img src="http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/0318/20150318_012601_torres.jpg" width="654" height="476">
<p></p>
<p>The first designated player in Rapids history, Torres is entering a crucial season. </p>
<p>"My goals are mostly the same as the ones that the group has," Torres said through a translator Tuesday. "We want to win games and be able to get to the playoffs." </p>
<p>The Panamanian international was a highly touted signing in 2013, but he missed time in 2014 because of fitness issues. He then had trouble grabbing hold of a starting spot. </p>
<p>However, Torres performed well this preseason in the No. 10 role, a play-making attacker underneath the target striker, and had two goals and an assist in the Desert Diamond Cup. With <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/rapids/ci_27727234/deshorn-brown-dealt-by-rapids-norwegian-club-v" title="www.denverpost.com">Deshorn Brown's sale to Norwegian club V&aring;lerenga</a>, the Rapids are slightly bare at the striker position, leading some to speculate that Powers could assume the No. 10 role, pushing Torres up top. </p>
<p>The 26-year-old said he will be ready wherever he's needed.</p>
<p>"Whether it's as the lone striker or as an attacking midfielder," Torres said, "I just need to contribute to the group as much as I can, and hopefully I can score plenty of goals this season."</p>
<center><hr width="50%"></center>
<center><h3>Dillon Powers</h3></center>
<img src="http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/0318/20150318_012458_powers.jpg" width="654" height="476">
<p></p>
<p>The Rapids' two-time team MVP enters his third season in burgundy as Mastroeni's "Swiss Army knife."</p>
<p>"One of Powers' better attributes," Mastroeni said Tuesday, "is understanding what the game is asking for, and adapting and assimilating to what's it's asking." </p>
<p>Powers, a Notre Dame alumnus, was used out wide on the right side as a second-half sub in the season-opening match against Philly while he continues to find his match fitness. Powers got time as a target striker, and has played as a deep-lying midfielder at times throughout his MLS career. </p>
<p>"At the end of the day, I think his favorite position is that No. 10 position," Mastroeni said of Powers on Tuesday. "And he's been really effective there for us."</p>
